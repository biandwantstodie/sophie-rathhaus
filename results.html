  <h4>lain's story</h4>
  <h6>childhood</h6>
    <p>I was an anxious child. My home life was a happy one, however my family had their stresses and bumps in the road with jobs stress, money and health.

      I was the youngest, and seemed to take all this in and carry it with me. I was a very happy child, and had a great childhood, however I was aware of all the stresses around me, but was unaware of who or how to talk about them. This same kind of behaviour followed me through all my primary school education, and into my time at secondary.
      
      As I got older I started to understand more about my family life and that I wasn’t the one who should always try to fix everything and make everyone feel better. However, life got stressful in other ways.
      
      The increase in academic stress, common stress at school with exams and tests, peer pressure and feeling different, and struggling with my sexuality, all accounted for some pretty poor levels of mental wellbeing. This was a common thing among me and my peers, and we found solace in each other and – when we could – our families.
      
      I struggled throughout the first few years of my undergraduate degree at university, and finally sought support from my GP following a major death in the family – which I thought at the time had triggered the stresses and anxiety in my life.</p> 
  <h6>lack of support in school</h6> 
  <p>Throughout my school life I was pretty unaware of mental health when it was not in crisis mode. My mother has been on and off antidepressants almost my whole life, and I saw how mental health was represented on TV as always being a crisis situation, so I was aware of low depressive moods and aware of help that was out there when you have a clinical diagnosis of depression.

    However, I was never introduced to wellbeing and introduced to early intervention methods. My school had a good ethos of being able to speak to your pastoral care teacher when things got tough. However, it felt like you were wasting their time if you went and you were not in crisis.</p>
