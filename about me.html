<h1>about the creator</h1>
<br>
<p>hi, my name is sophie rathhaus and i am a senior at oakland technical high school. 
  i have struggled with my mental health in the past and am still struggling today, 
  so i wanted to create a wensite where you can find links to helpful sites, and see other people's storys, while sharing your own.</p>
<h3>my story</h3>
<p>I have struggled with ADHD, and OCD since being diagnosed in middle school, and in some ways it was relieving while also being a new challenge. 
  It was nice for me to understand why I was having trouble and falling behind where other people weren’t. 
  Additionally I gained new strategies that I still use: asking for help, recognizing when I need help, going to office hours, time management, 
  and after school tutoring when I need it, and realizing the time and work that I need to do in order to succeed. 
  One class that I often have to use these strategies in is math. Usually I can quickly grasp the concepts that we are supposed to understand and I am able to stay on top of things.
   On the other hand when I don’t understand something or the pacing of the class doesn’t fit my learning style it’s hard for me to stay on top of my work. 
   Last year when I found myself falling behind I got a tutor to help me work through the information I didn’t understand
    and the year before that I would stay in for lunch sometimes to get help from the teacher on problems I couldn’t grasp. 
    It’s still hard to cope with the fact I will always have this barrier in the way of my learning and there is nothing I can do to change that, 
  however it has also given me a different outlook on life and by seeing things differently than most people. 
  I’m also able to apply that to school and notice and think about topics in a way most people don’t.</p>
